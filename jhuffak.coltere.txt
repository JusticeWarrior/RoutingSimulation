All unit tests pass and the router should be fully functional.

If a router is suspended using CTRL+Z, the other routers should be able
to sucessfully detect that it is missing and update their tables accordingly.
(It may be stopped other ways but using CTRL+Z made it easy to start it
again)

After bringing the stopped router back with "fg", the other routers should be
able receive updates and add it back into their routing tables.
